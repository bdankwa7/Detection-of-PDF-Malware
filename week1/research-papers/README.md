Questions that need answers:
* What is adversarial machine learning (at a high level)?
* How do these attacks use the gradient of deep neural nets to execute their attacks?
* Why are adversarial attacks of concern?
* Is it easier to attack or defend a neural net?
* What do you think is the most interesting attack or feature of an attack?
